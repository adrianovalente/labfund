# LABFUND - Foundations of Computing Engineering

Hey! When I was a student, I had to learn something about the [Von Neumann Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture), a simple computer architecture containing a memory, a single bus, some general registers and some specials ones, such as the Program Counter and the Accumulator. During the [course](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=PCS2024&verdis=1), we had to write some assembly and Java code.
